# Welcome to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the HPC!

This tutorial is an independent, beginner-oriented introduction to the DTU High-Performance Computing (HPC) system. It is intended as a practical supplement to the official [DTU HPC documentation](https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/), not a replacement. For users experienced with linux CLI, we advise you to start [here](https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/?page_id=2501) instead.

<!-- The tutorial is in most respects to be considered a practical extension of [DTU HPCs own material](https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/), and for users experienced with linux CLI, we advise you to start [here](https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/?page_id=2501) instead.  -->

We aditionally provide a GitHub repository which aids in establishing a viable project structure as well as an interactive code debugger in order for you to get started with your project as quickly as possible.
