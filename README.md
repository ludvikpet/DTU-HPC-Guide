# Welcome to a beginner friendly DTU HPC guide! 


DTU HPC is DTUs computing cluster service, offering state of the art computing solution for developing computationally advanced algorithms. 

It is a more versatile alternative to services such as Google colab, as it allows to run experiments without connection and with control over the hardware used. 

This GitHub repository serves two purposes; 
1. Serving **The Hitchiker's Guide to the HPC**, a step-by-step beginner friendly guide which may be accessed [here!](https://ludvikpet.github.io/DTU-HPC-Guide/)
2. Providing code infrastructure on the main branch for quickly setting up a project and allowing debugging on the HPC.  


The guide is in most practical aspects to be considered a practical extension of [DTU HPCs own material](https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/), adapted tp users with little to no prior experience using cluster services or linux. 

This tutorial has been made by Ludvík Petersen and Martin Ægidius.

If you use the tutorial, please remember to cite the [DTU DCC](https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/?page_id=4061), who are the primary source of information.
